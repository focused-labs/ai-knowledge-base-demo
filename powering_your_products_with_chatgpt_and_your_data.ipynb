    "# Power your products with ChatGPT and your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a walkthrough taking readers through how to build starter Q&A and Chatbot applications using the ChatGPT API and their own data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is laid out in these sections:\n",
    "- **Setup:** \n",
    "    - Initiate variables and source the data\n",
    "- **Lay the foundations:**\n",
    "    - Set up the vector database to accept vectors and data\n",
    "    - Load the dataset, chunk the data up for embedding and store in the vector database\n",
    "- **Make it a product:**\n",
    "    - Add a retrieval step where users provide queries and we return the most relevant entries\n",
    "    - Summarise search results with GPT-3\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Q&A app in Streamlit\n",
    "- **Build your moat:**\n",
    "    - Create an Assistant class to manage context and interact with our bot\n",
    "    - Use the Chatbot to answer questions using semantic search context\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Chatbot app in Streamlit\n",
    "    \n",
    "Upon completion, you have the building blocks to create your own production chatbot or Q&A application using OpenAI APIs and a vector database.\n",

Launches aren’t a one-time event. Most companies do a ton of work for the launch, but don’t spend enough   time on what happens after. A good launch means sustaining the momentum once the confetti settles.    Most people suck at managing up. They waste their boss’ time with too much (or too little) information.

When successful, the organization experiences validated product market   fit through growing product adoption, effective cross-functional coordination, and predictable   delivery of new features and updates.     The history of product management is long and has evolved tremendously over the years. Its   inception dates all the way back to Proctor and Gamble in the 1930s as the “Brand Man”. The   origin of product management have customer centricity and aligning business goals at its core.   However, the implementation of the practice in the organization has shifted as industries changed   and had dramatic impacts on the role of a product manager. From being a part of the marketing   organization to going very close to product development and part of the technical organization.   Only in the last 10-15 years has product management been shifting into its own function (not   reporting up through technology or marketing) within organizations such that products built with   customer centricity are directly aligned to business vision and goals. As Mind the Product states,   this makes product management “internal as well as external evangelists of that vision, and gives   them the independence necessary to make tough prioritization calls.”    Some of the most popular agile frameworks used today include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and   Extreme Programming (XP). Each framework has its own set of principles, processes, and   practices that can be tailored to fit the needs of a specific organization or project. The role of the   product manager, and the name of the role itself (!), can vary greatly within an organization. It is   often influenced by the size of the organization, the industry, the organization’s choice of agile   framework and the career history of senior leaders.     The following is an articulation of how Focused Labs views the role and responsibilities of a   product manager, as well as the core principles and practices we deploy when doing product   management with clients.    Product Management at Focused Labs1🦎  \fThe Product Manager’s Role & Responsibilities  Product managers are responsible for identifying customer needs, defining product requirements,   and overseeing the product development process. They work with cross-functional teams,   including executive leadership, engineering, design, marketing, and sales, to ensure that the   product meets the market demand and is delivered on time and within budget. Additionally,   product managers are responsible for setting product strategy, conducting market research, and   analyzing data to inform product decisions. Overall, the product manager's goal is to create   and deliver a successful product that meets customer needs and drives business growth.    Reforge has already done a great job of breaking the Product Manager’s role and responsibilities   down into its most generic form.     What Does a Product Manager Do? Key Roles & Responsibilities — Reforge  What does a product manager do? We asked our product experts to outline key   product manager roles & responsibilities.    https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/what-does-a-product-manager-do?rq=pr    oduct%20management    Principles First    A principle is a fundamental truth or belief that guides decision-making and behavior. The   following are the core values and beliefs that guide Focused Labs product managers in their   approach to product development.    Outcome-driven - We believe in identifying and measuring the success of a product based   on the impact it has on the desired outcomes, rather than just the number of features or   releases. It prioritizes identifying and solving customer problems that align with business   goals.  Working Software Above All Else - We believe that the most reliable and effective feedback   comes from an application deployed to production. Therefore, we pursue small, incremental   releases to create short feedback loops. Our ability to be highly effective agile project   managers, regardless of our seniority as product managers, enables us to deliver reliably.    Cross-functional Collaboration — We believe that effective product management requires   close collaboration with cross-functional teams, including engineering, design, marketing, and   leadership. Product managers should be able to work effectively with these teams to ensure   that the product meets its goals.    Product Management at Focused Labs2\fContinuous Improvement — We believe that no product is ever truly \"done\". By reviewing   customer feedback and data, product managers should be able to identify opportunities for   improvement and make necessary changes to the product.    User Centricity — We believe that everything starts and ends with the user. Product   managers are responsible for representing the voice of the customer and making sure that the   product meets their needs.  Agile Mindset — We believe in the Extreme Programming (XP) agile framework because of   its efficacy in delivering high quality software predictably. Product managers are familiar with   other agile frameworks and are able to adapt them to the needs of the organization alongside   XP.     We also acknowledge that the Extreme Programming guidance has not been updated to   provide clear and consistent guidance for the roles of product management and design in   a cross-functional software development team. We may at times make strategic   adjustments to our practices and processes to more effectively enable modern product   management to be embedded in our cross-functional development teams.    Data-driven Decision Making — We believe in using data and insights to make informed   decisions about the product. Product managers are able to interpret data and use it to drive   product strategy.    Product Management at Focused Labs3\f\n",
