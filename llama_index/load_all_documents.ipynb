Manufacturing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery: Replaced legacy manual spreadsheet process with software that was scalable for BTR Energy and clients. Software manages and records charging events for over 100,000 electric vehicles (EV), while also automating reporting to a California regulator and to BTR Energy’s clients. Built and deployed a client-facing application for streamlining onboarding with BTR Energy’s Bridge platform and the management of EV charging data.\\nFocused on Results: Software propelled BTR Energy’s evolution from a software-enabled services company to a software-first product company for EV manufacturers and others.\\nFocused on Partnership: Focused Labs was trusted to serve as the technology arm of BTR Energy and has helped foster direct client relationships to build business-critical software. Developers at Focused Labs have become an integral part of BTR Energy’s success and growth over the last year.\\nAgile workflow enabled startup BTR Energy to automate workflows\\nBTR Energy launched in 2019 to provide a platform that automates participation in low carbon fuels programs, like California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). BTR Energy’s platform connects EV manufacturers, fleet operators, and charging station networks to renewable electricity producers in order to generate LCFS “credits”. Together, BTR Energy and its clients use charging data from EVs to make quarterly submissions to the California Air Resources Board and to generate LCFS credits. These credits can be sold, generating revenue for BTR Energy and its clients. BTR Energy keeps a small percentage of this revenue, providing the majority to the EV manufacturers, fleet operators, or charging station networks, and the renewable electricity producers.\\nInitially, BTR Energy managed all of its data in spreadsheets, but its platform now collects near real-time EV charging data and automatically processes that data and creates the reports necessary to generate LCFS credits, making it possible to manage a much larger amount of data from more and more diverse clients.\\nThe engagement between BTR Energy and Focused Labs started in early 2020. Focused Labs started by automating small parts of the manual spreadsheet based solution BTR Energy was using. BTR Energy understood that this legacy system would not be scalable and would not be able to meet the needs of its clients. As such, Focused Labs set out to build a better way to manage the data, improving and automating and BTR Energy’s engagements with its clients.\\nOpportunity to evolve and grow BTR Energy’s capabilities\\nBTR Energy needed scalable ways to catalog, analyze and share large amounts of charging data between EV manufacturers and regulators, while also preserving consumer privacy and a high … of data protection. Spreadsheets could not serve the business, so Focused Labs built the BTR Energy “Bridge” platform, which includes direct integrations with its clients. This makes the transmission of EV charging data much more seamless for both BTR Energy and its clients.\\nBTR Bridge Platform\\n\\nCreated a React and Spring Boot-based application to:\\n\\nManage a fleet of over 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs)\\nRecord charging events for the EV fleet\\nGenerate quarterly registration and charging submissions for a California regulatory program, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard\\n\\n\\nCaptured over 8 million unique charging events from 4 different vehicle manufacturers.\\nImplemented a PostGIS-backed geo-filtering system that allows performant filtering of hundreds of thousands of charging events against 30,000 public charging stations in California.\\n\\nHaving an app to manage such a large amount of vehicle data and automating its delivery to the relevant regulator made it a valuable asset to both BTR Energy and their clients.\\nSince the development and deployment of the Bridge platform, BTR Energy has shifted from a software-enabled services business to a software-centric company.\\n\\n\\n“The software became the business,” says Jack Barrow, CEO of BTR Energy.\\n\\n\\nTrusting Focused Labs to meet directly with BTR Energy’s clients\\nOnce the BTR Bridge Platform was deployed, BTR Energy needed a technology-forward strategy with its clients. Barrow and his partners at BTR Energy trusted Focused Labs’ technology and people so much that they brought them to collaborative meetings with clients and prospects interested in integrating with BTR Energy’s software. At the time, BTR Energy did not have a full in-house technology team, so Focused Labs developers took on that role.\\nTrusting an outside company to meet with your clients (especially when the potential client pool is relatively small) is not a role Focused Labs took lightly. “We were looking for technical talent, but also people with the ability to maintain a relationship — and we absolutely got that from Focused Labs,” Barrow says. “We took [Focused Labs co-founders] Austin and Luke to Michigan to meet with one of our largest clients, and they just hit it off with everyone. I think it was helpful for BTR Energy’s credibility.”\\nBTR Energy’s trust in Focused Labs continues. Two developers from Focused Labs directly work with BTR Energy’s client tech teams to address and manage business needs as they arrive. In addition to fielding the needs of client tech teams, a core responsibility of the Focused Labs team has been the constant improvement of BTR Energy’s security posture. For each integration, a robust security review is conducted by BTR Energy’s clients. BTR Energy trusts Focused Labs to field these reviews and strengthen their security with each subsequent one; BTR Energy is now compliant with hundreds of specific security requirements imposed on it by its clients.\\nFinally, BTR Energy relied on the Focused Labs team to demonstrate the software’s capabilities to investors during a funding round in August 2021. This demonstration ultimately helped BTR secure those funds and advance the company forward.\\n\\n\\n“Client and investor presentations are important moments for an early-stage company like BTR Energy. Just as Austin and Luke had made a positive impression on our clients in 2020, Focused Labs engineers made a positive impression on investors in 2021. Enthusiasm for BTR Energy noticeably grew after the presentations, and both investors that met the Focused Labs team ultimately participated in BTR Energy’ Series A, a testament, in part, to the quality of the software and the presentations.”\\n\\n\\nBuilding a client-facing app for enhanced experience\\nInitially, the Bridge platform primarily supported work within BTR Energy — it was more functional than pretty. Once the business grew to work with automakers and their APIs, a client-facing friendly dashboard needed to be built. Focused Labs and BTR Energy collaborated to make and deploy a version of the Bridge platform for its clients.\\nThe Bridge For Clients\\nFocused Labs developers and BTR Energy worked together to:\\n\\nBuild a standardized REST API to allow BTR Energy to scale and onboard new clients faster (3 new clients since Summer 2020).\\nIterated on client platform in Spring 2021 to allow BTR to onboard client with new types of electric equipment (charging stations).\\nBuild and deploy a client-facing dashboard between March and June 2021 to allow clients new visibility into their charging data and the resulting LCFS credits.\\nConducted a thorough demo to potential investors in August 2021 to demonstrate the software’s capabilities during a funding round.\\nPlanned and executed a deployment infrastructure migration to improve BTR Energy’s security posture and technological independence in October 2021\\n\\nMaking integrations as easy as possible from the client side is paramount to BTR Energy’s business plan. The easier it is for an automaker or other clients to directly onboard with BTR Energy’s applications, the smoother the business relationship will be.\\nThe culture of Focused Labs will be the future of BTR Energy software\\nBTR Energy has grown significantly during its engagement with Focused Labs. As BTR Energy adapted to client needs, Focused Labs has been there to provide the technology and expertise needed for growth within tight timeframes. Eventually, BTR Energy will hire its own internal software development team, but the standards for building business changing software and doing so quickly will stand as the minimum. Focused Labs’ core practices of pair programming, CI/CD, and test-driven development have laid a foundation that future BTR Energy developers can build on in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n433

Delivery: Built and deployed mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. Built and deployed portal for TNC team to get necessary documents to rideshare renters. Developed software to build a last-mile delivery market.\\nFocused on Results: In the first 3 months of using the mobile app, the recovery of numerous stolen vehicles saved the company hundreds of thousands in inventory. The last-mile delivery app contributed to Hertz’s bottom-line increase in revenue.\\nFocused on Partnership: Focused Labs built and deployed numerous applications with quick turnaround times — showing the developers at Hertz that technology solutions can be fast, functional, and profitable. Focused Labs took a very enablement-centric approach during the development process. Although Hertz had a very capable engineering team, they relied on Focused Labs to bring new, impactful, and sustainable engineering practices into their organization.\\nHelping Hertz Leverage Technology To Capture New Markets\\nDiversifying lines of business is one of the best ways to leverage technology within a company. More and more, technology and outside forces are shaping industries in new, quick ways that can make age-old businesses feel like they are in a constant state of flux. For instance, car rental giant Hertz and similar companies were upended as the pandemic shut down almost all global travel and put the need to rent cars at a standstill. Technology has helped Hertz rebound and opens up new lines of business while also finding solutions to old problems. But they didn’t always have the technology infrastructure to respond proactively to these issues.\\nHertz hired Opal Perry as Global CIO — to rebuild a technology-forward culture that would see digital solutions as a way to grow new business and not just a functional necessity.\\nIn the past, Hertz had outsourced a lot of its technology needs to external vendors. While it was functional for the ways technology had previously served Hertz, using outside vendors left their technology arm with a lack of innovation. An agile technology team within a business can know the pain points and work to fix them swiftly. Putting the innovation needs of a business into a third party is hard if you want to move quickly.\\nPerry needed to build up a technology team at Hertz that could be proactive in finding new solutions to their fast-paced business problems.\\nThat’s why she hired Focused Labs.\\nNavigating a culture and technology transformation\\nFocused Labs’ work with Hertz started in January of 2020. The company had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic that globally put all travel to a standstill. Hertz needed to build technological solutions to pivot their business to encompass new ventures that could live outside of the usual model of renting cars direct to consumers.\\nTo do that, Hertz also needed to change the development culture. This transformation could leverage technology to discover new lines of business or improve older ways of working.\\n“We wanted fast help to get the work done,” says Perry, “but also to embed the culture and ways of working that we want to be our target state.”\\nTwo Focused Labs developers paired with two members of the Hertz RevLab team to get to work. By working directly alongside team members of Hertz, they were able to learn the kinds of methods and curiosity Focused Labs keeps top of mind when developing a new piece of software.\\nBuilding a more durable business with technology solutions\\nWork between Focused Labs developers and the Hertz RevLab in Bannockburn, IL started with finding out what business opportunities currently exist and could exist in the future. They were looking for ways that technology could pivot to new business lines and software to support that business line could be built and deployed. The quicker a business can adjust to a market in flux, the more durable that business can become in the long term.\\nSVU: Stolen Vehicles Unit\\nThe initial engagement between Hertz and Focused Labs started with a discovery process to identify areas in which Hertz may be underutilizing their existing vehicles. Through this process, they found that substantial time was being lost within the organization due to vehicle theft. It was time-consuming to identify a vehicle had been stolen and the longer the vehicle went undetected as stolen, the less likely it was to be returned.\\nHertz RevLab and Focused Labs embarked on a project called SVU (stolen vehicles unit). The teams built and deployed a mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. So far it has been wildly successful. In the first 3 months of use, numerous stolen Hertz vehicles were recovered — which saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory.\\nWorking with stakeholders inside Hertz, including the executive team, helped Focused Labs to scope, shape, and prioritize the way software was ideated, built, and deployed into use.\\nTNC: Transportation Network Company\\nOne of the business lines outside of Hertz\\'s standard consumer rentals is TNC — a program that rents vehicles to Uber and Lyft rideshare drivers. Often someone will decide against buying another vehicle or using their own in favor of renting a vehicle to drive customers where they need to go. Uber and Lyft are both technology-forward companies with everything necessary to their business living within an app on the driver and rider’s phones. Hertz needed a similarly easy-to-use portal for TNC partners to access all of the necessary compliance documents that come with standard rideshare agreements.\\nBeing able to adjust to the needs of fast-paced markets like ridesharing is a big benefit to doing this work in an agile way. “We’re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We’ve gained speed-to-market and agility,” says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz’s Transportation Network Company. “Now we’re never a week away from making a material change to our strategy.”\\n\\n\\n“We’re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We’ve gained speed-to-market and agility,” says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz’s Transportation Network Company.\\n\\n\\nGaining new revenue streams for Hertz with last-mile delivery\\nAs the pandemic cut down on vehicle rentals, Hertz had to develop new ways to use the existing fleets of vehicles and staff still on hand. There was an opportunity in the fact that delivery services were booming as so many people were no longer doing their shopping in person.\\nMaking tens of thousands of software-enabled deliveries within retail shipping\\nIn less than 3 weeks, Focused Labs and Hertz developers built an initial dispatching system to fulfill a new market for Hertz — last-mile delivery. A retail partner hired Hertz to finish off deliveries they needed to reach their customers. This opened the door for Focused Labs to help develop that software.\\nFrom July - November 2020:\\n\\nThe dispatching system was iterated and improved upon\\nFocused Labs built a mobile application to support both delivery drivers and deliver customers package insights\\nFocused Labs built an invoicing system so Hertz could automate billing their retail partners using this new service.\\n\\nThese pieces of software-enabled Hertz to provide the retailer with the capability to reach a broader customer delivery base. Hertz generated revenue that would not have been able to happen without quick technology solutions.\\nIncreased revenue captured via logistics\\nHertz leveraged its logistics partnerships to fulfill last-mile deliveries. Focused Labs helped lead the team in building the software to make this highly profitable venture feasible.\\nIn a short time-frame Hertz and Focused Labs:\\n\\nBuilt and deployed a React Native mobile application to the Google Play store in 2 weeks.\\nBuilt a backend API and integration with a partner to enable delivery manifests to automatically deploy to the app.\\nProvided support for partner last-mile deliveries.\\n\\nThis extremely quick app deployment helped Hertz and its partner realize a material increase in package deliveries and generated a new stream of revenue. These quick turnarounds for such large deliverables proved out the methods of Focused Labs.\\nChanging the future of Hertz technology\\nThe deliverables in these quickly turned around projects is undeniable, which is why the partnership between Focused Labs and Hertz is still going. The number of Focused Labs developers engaged has increased to ten, to cover more ground in building and embedding culture. Thanks to Focused Labs’ enablement approach, Hertz is steadily evolving its technology culture to be a place where the kind of agile developers who can deliver the best technology will want to work.\\nIn hiring Focused Labs, Hertz not only gained agility and flexibility but also learned new engineering practices. Focused Labs helped show Hertz developers the kind of autonomy and confidence needed to build the right piece of software for right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease leave your contact information for more details about your project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture’s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\\nAperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson’s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team’s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery\\n\\nFocused Labs developers accelerated product delivery for one of Aperture’s largest clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Results\\n\\nFocused Labs quickly saved a time-sensitive project abandoned by previous development contractors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Partnership\\n\\nAperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery: Focused Labs developers accelerated product delivery for one of Aperture’s largest clients, while building a primary source verification (PSV) API to enable verification and credentialing. During these projects, Focused Labs enabled Aperture’s team with the benefits of Extreme Programming.\\nFocused on Results: Quickly saved a time-sensitive project abandoned by previous development contractors. The PSV API made verification possible within hours instead of weeks. Aperture’s engineers have embraced more pair programming work and significantly improved the daily working relationships between Aperture and client stakeholders.\\nFocused on Partnership: Aperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams while also quickly building software for a client. This will give Aperture a more agile approach to building and deploying valuable software going forward.\\nGuiding an agile Transformation for Aperture’s Development Team\\nAperture Health wanted to work smarter — an agile transformation in product and software development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture’s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\\nAperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson’s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team’s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\\nBuilding time-saving healthcare API’s ahead of schedule\\nThe first development project between Aperture and Focused Labs started in December of 2020. The previous team of developers had ended their contract before finishing the job, so understanding the work and its context was the biggest issue in getting started.\\nThe project needed to be finished quickly and Focused Labs was up for the challenge. “Having partners who can quickly staff up like Focused is nice to have,” says Will Reed, former head of engineering at Aperture. “They basically hopped onto a speeding train from a standstill.”\\nAperture needed Focused Labs to help build out a primary source verification (PSV) API for a client. PSV is the method a healthcare provider uses to verify someone has the right certificate, license or registration to practice a profession. This important piece of Aperture client’s work was taking weeks to accomplish due to lack of automation in sharing that data.\\nFocused Labs quickly built a self-service API that enabled Aperture’s client to accomplish PSV within hours —not days. By automating the data retrieval process between accreditor and provider, this software cut PSV requests — which could manually take more than three days — down to four hours. They further streamlined the process by then developing automated billing and invoicing for the API clients.\\nAnd they delivered it all three weeks ahead of schedule.\\nProving the benefits of an agile transformation through pair programming\\nDuring this project, Focused Labs’ developers worked alongside Aperture’s to show the benefits of pair programming. Aperture wanted to move away from a waterfall type workflow to more iterative development. Focused Labs showed Aperture’s team the benefits of things like weekly team rituals and a cadenced release schedule for a project in progress.\\nFocused Labs also collaborated with Aperture to bring more modern tooling into their work environment. When partnering with development teams, Focused Labs always looks to implement new modern systems. With Aperture, the legacy applications they were previously working with made it virtually impossible to find out when the software Aperture was providing to its clients was faltering. To close that feedback loop between Aperture’s clients and Aperture, Focused Labs suggested and then implemented new tooling — such as New Relic — to facilitate performance monitoring. This way the client did not need to alert developers when things were breaking — they now had the tools to monitor performance themselves.\\nThrough working in a more collaborative, agile process, Aperture was able to solve problems in smaller chunks which led to a greater end result. Focused Labs also worked directly with Aperture’s client development team to mend the communication and relationship that had been strained by the contractors who left the project unfinished. This direct communication and collaboration has led to significant improvement in workflow and understanding between Aperture and their client stakeholders.\\nMaking an agile transition away from top-down workflow\\nAperture could have used any other development partner, but what was appealing about Focused Labs was the culture and workflow they were able to model with Aperture’s team.\\n\\n\\nFocused Labs are educators and modelers of new behaviors and new practices.\\nOur team brought the knowledge of the tech stack and Focused Labs were bringing tools in terms of how to work and how to gain confidence about the software that is being built. Everyone’s adding value from day one,” says Reed. “Focused Labs are transferring their process to us and their job is to get out of here.”\\n\\n\\nFocused Labs embodied the best ways to produce valuable software to Aperture’s clients and worked alongside them to ensure they knew it was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease

From their top notch team to seamless process, they helped to optimize our business backend operations and web experience for our clients. Before working with Focused Labs, we managed many of our systems manually, taking valuable human capital away from our customers. Now our systems are automated, allowing us to put our focus back on our customers. I couldn\\'t recommend anyone more highly than the Focused Labs team.”\\nCaitlyn Fagan, Chief Operating Officer at Inner Matrix Systems\\n\\n\\nAbout\\nInner Matrix System (IMS) is a personal development company that aims to help clients create a meaningful and fulfilling life. Founded by Joey Klein, the program engages clients with guided meditations, 1:1 training, and weekend events.\\nProblem Space\\nEven before the pandemic, IMS had been looking to modernize their digital experiences, which were outdated and not user friendly. Users wanted an easier experience when registering for events, accessing digital materials and viewing upcoming programs and events. The business wanted to create a more professional digital presence, update their programming platform, and scale offerings. With the onset of COVID, it was the perfect opportunity, and business critical, to improve their technology.\\nSolution\\nUsing an iterative approach, the Focused Labs team built and modernized IMS’s new digital presence in phases, which included website rebuilds, a mobile app, updated backend services, and content migration.\\nPhase I\\n\\nRebuild the existing Inner Matrix Group (IMG) and Inner Matrix System (IMS) websites. Automate registration for events and programs to reduce admin hours spent manually registering members. Create a self-registration flow for members, and a trainer portal for trainers and apprentices to manage courses and payments.\\n\\nPhase II\\n\\nMigrate digital and audio visual content from Wordpress to EKS with a Vue and Rails backend to provide greater flexibility in how content can be accessed. Deprecate legacy systems.\\n\\nPhase III\\n\\nCreate a mobile app that allows community members to engage with IMS content offline and on the go. Build a membership registration flow that provides unique access and pricing to IMS content and programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was easy to navigate! Loved the FAQ section with the dropdown boxes. Everything was very clear and easy to understand! Thank you for all the effort to make this a wonderful tool for changing lives.\"\\nIMS Customer\\n\\n\\nApproach\\nOur team at Focused started each phase of work with a scoping session, to map out and understand what we were building. Then, we built out a backlog to sustain the team for a few weeks and got to work. On Mondays, we kicked off the week with an iterative planning meeting. In this hour, we talked about immediate priorities, asked questions about business processes that impacted features, and discussed any challenges. Other weekly rituals for the team included morning standups and a weekly retro.\\nDuring each phase, we partnered closely with the IMS team and subject matter experts. We mapped out process flows, interviewed users, and highlighted business requirements, to ensure that we were building the right thing.\\n\\nResults\\nWith updated and more automated tools, the IMS team has seen a reduction in customer complaints and help calls. Their customers and trainers are thrilled with the updates. Moreover, administrators now have more insight and control into setting up and managing events and products, which lets them react faster to customer needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease leave your contact information for more details about your project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Get in touch with us\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n433 W Van Buren St\\nSuite 1100-B\\nChicago, IL 60607\\n(708) 303-8088\\n\\n\\n\\nwork@focusedlabs.io\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nHome\\nAbout\\nServices\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEXPLORE\\n\\nCase Studies\\nBlog\\nCareers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2022 Focused Labs, All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvar hsVars = hsVars || {}; hsVars[\\'language\\'] = \\'en\\';\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        var options = {\\n            portalId: \\'5845897\\',\\n            formId: \\'4a2f1fab-24b7-4829-8563-e147046be648\\',\\n            formInstanceId: \\'2439\\',\\n            pageId: \\'94291621513\\',\\n            region: \\'na1\\',\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            pageName: \"Focused Labs\",\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            inlineMessage: \"Thanks for submitting the form.\",\\n            \\n            \\n            rawInlineMessage: \"Thanks for submitting the form.\",\\n            \\n            \\n            hsFormKey: \"4d48110c231634813a6b20d7edf2fece\",\\n            \\n            \\n            css: \\'\\',\\n            target: \\'#hs_form_target_form_681301388\\',\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            contentType: \"standard-page\",\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            formsBaseUrl: \\'/_hcms/forms/\\',\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            formData: {\\n                cssClass: \\'hs-form stacked hs-custom-form\\'\\n            }\\n        };\\n\\n        options.getExtraMetaDataBeforeSubmit = function() {\\n            var metadata = {};\\n            \\n\\n            if (hbspt.targetedContentMetadata) {\\n                var count = hbspt.targetedContentMetadata.length;\\n                var targetedContentData = [];\\n                for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {\\n                    var tc = hbspt.targetedContentMetadata[i];\\n                     if ( tc.length !== 3) {\\n                        continue;\\n                     }\\n                     targetedContentData.push({\\n                        definitionId: tc[0],\\n                        criterionId: tc[1],\\n                        smartTypeId: tc[2]\\n                     });\\n                }\\n                metadata[\"targetedContentMetadata\"] = JSON.stringify(targetedContentData);\\n            }\\n\\n            return metadata;\\n        };\\n\\n        hbspt.forms.create(options);\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nvar _hsq = _hsq || [];\\n_hsq.push([\"setContentType\", \"standard-page\"]);\\n_hsq.push([\"setCanonicalUrl\", \"https:\\\\/\\\\/focusedlabs.io\\\\/case-studies\\\\/automated-core-business-functionality\"]);\\n_hsq.push([\"setPageId\", \"94291621513\"]);\\n_hsq.push([\"setContentMetadata\", {\\n    \"contentPageId\": 94291621513,\\n    \"legacyPageId\": \"94291621513\",\\n    \"contentFolderId\": null,\\n    \"contentGroupId\": null,\\n    \"abTestId\": null,\\n    \"languageVariantId\": 94291621513,\\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\\n    \\n}]);\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvar hsVars = {\\n    render_id: \"d83d2373-6506-450f-ab81-7c8e13377611\",\\n    ticks: 1687505284043,\\n    page_id: 94291621513,\\n    \\n    content_group_id: 0,\\n    portal_id: 5845897,\\n    app_hs_base_url: \"https://app.hubspot.com\",\\n    cp_hs_base_url: \"https://cp.hubspot.com\",\\n    language: \"en\",\\n    analytics_page_type: \"standard-page\",\\n    analytics_page_id: \"94291621513\",\\n    category_id: 1,\\n    folder_id: 0,\\n    is_hubspot_user: false\\n}\\n\\n\\n', doc_id='832b2277-ef51-46dd-8117-90dcca55cd35', embedding=None, doc_hash='884394be9cf21ca495a4f8d7fd79d2700b7270949b571297af97f66e57809eee', extra_info={'URL': 'https://focusedlabs.io/case-studies/automated-core-business-functionality'})]\n",
